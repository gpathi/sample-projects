The code is arranged as follows:

        1. Code under modules, themes shows style of my coding 

        2. The scripts directory has two scripts, on of those is hw_google_rollout.php. 
           This was an interesting issue I had faced in one of  my projects were we had to 
           update close to 800 sites that were in production. The project used panels and
           the issue was one of the panel had to be updated. The update had to be done in
           production on the live site. Since it is a panel update and it is featurized.

        3. The other script in the script directory was an extension to hw_google_rollout.php 
           above wherein once the panel is updated, the change had to checked into Git. One
           neat thing about this script is that this code can be used to enhance Features 
           module, to checkin the Feature once its been created.
